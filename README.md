👩‍🎓 I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science (specializing in Systems and Software) from Northeastern University. I am on the lookout for full-time opportunities in Software Engineering starting Jan 2025.

🔭 As a Software Engineer Intern at Sequoia Capital, I'm actively applying my graduate studies in Computer Science, focusing on building data pipelines using Ruby, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Rails to feed into Large language models to automate generation of various investment strategies. 

👩‍💻 During my time as a Software Engineer Co-op at Fulfil, I led end-to-end development of various services such as Mars Status Updater Agent and Reservation System, harnessing C#, MongoDB, MySQL, REST APIs to enhance factory simulations and machine operations.

💼 Prior to beginning my studies at Northeastern, I spent fours years working as a Software Engineer at ServiceNow and Planful. During this time, I was an integral part of the core development team, responsible for driving product features end-to-end—from the requirement phase through the design phase to development. I bridged business needs with technical implementation, always considering performance and scalability thresholds. I am passionate about problem-solving, data structures, and designing application architecture, always eager to tackle new challenges and continuously expand my skill set.

Get in touch with me to discuss opportunities.
